A full sized version of the BKM-129X compatible board

Revision B

Should be able to be created at ~$40, with the ADG1611 being the most expensive component.

This requires an Arduino Nano v3 *or* the ATMEGA328PB mounted, which is then loaded with the
latest BKM-129X-MCU code from https://github.com/skumlos/bkm-129x-mcu (onboard MCU is still untested)

The has 4 switches to be able to turn internal 75 Ohm termination on out pass signal through to the output BNCs. You 
can choose to set all switches down, and then terminate with external termination resistors. If you wish to omit the
switches altogther, bridge the two pins bottom left of each switch (when viewed component side, BNCs to left). 
A 0 Ohm 0805 should be able to reach here I guess.

Connections from top to bottom when viewing component side, with BNCs to the left:

Just like the original BKM-129X.

You are welcome to clone, produce and sell hardware based on this. Please keep changes and so on open source.

Cool kids give credit where due.

---------

Should be compatible with basically all monitors that accept the original BKM-129X

Check the MCU code for verified compatibility.
